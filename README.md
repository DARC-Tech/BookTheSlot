We are developing a mobile Application and Web Application to make this system feasible and save people's time. We are building a platform that connects the Consumers and Sellers to make buying and selling of goods much easier during his pandemic time. 

We are building a platform that makes consumers book their time slot according to their requirement by checking the availability. Sellers set the slots and other parameters. They can even upload the list of available goods. This helps consumers in deciding which store to go.  

This platform can be used by Supermarkets, Medicals, Local Stores and even Government Ration Stores. This is an open and free platform available in the form of Mobile Application and Web Application. The user can download the Mobile App or can directly use the platform from its Website. This platform is being built using Flutter and is managed using Firebase. The Application Source code is available in GitHub(github.com/DARC-Tech/BookTheSlot).
